# XL Roadmap

> **Track Progress**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/TJC-LP/xl/issues)

**Last Updated**: 2026-06-07

> **Live trackers**: [v0.10.0-execution.md](v0.10.0-execution.md) (release tracker) and [v0.10.0-triage.md](v0.10.0-triage.md) (rationale + per-issue verdicts).

---

## TL;DR

**Current Status**: Production-ready with **104 formula functions** (incl. dynamic arrays SEQUENCE/SORT/UNIQUE/FILTER and OFFSET), **structural editing** (insert/delete rows & columns with formula rewriting), named-range & hyperlink authoring, SAX streaming (36% faster than POI), Excel tables, and full OOXML round-trip. 1100+ tests passing. **0.10.0 "Trust & Author"** is the active release — see [v0.10.0-execution.md](v0.10.0-execution.md).

**Current Version**: 0.9.7 → **0.10.0 "Trust & Author"** in progress

## Release Roadmap

### v0.10.0 "Trust & Author" (Current)

Build version 0.9.7 → **0.10.0 in progress**. Focus: trust (surgical-edit fidelity) and authoring (write the parts XL previously only read).

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Named-range authoring (`DefinedName` serialization + CLI `name add/rm`) | ✅ Done |
| Hyperlink authoring (`Cell.hyperlink` serialization) | ✅ Done |
| Structural editing — insert/delete rows & columns with formula rewriting (cross-sheet, `#REF!` generation) | ✅ Done |
| Formula breadth — registry 88 → **104 functions** (IFS, SWITCH, CHOOSE, LARGE, SMALL, RANK, PERCENTILE, QUARTILE, HLOOKUP, MAXIFS, MINIFS, OFFSET, dynamic arrays SEQUENCE/SORT/UNIQUE/FILTER) | ✅ Done |
| Trust fixes C1–C5 — preserve inline worksheet elements (dataValidations, sheetProtection, autoFilter) through edits | ✅ Done |
| Theme color resolution (`ThemePalette.resolve`, `toResolvedArgb`/`toResolvedHex`) | ✅ Done |
| Configurable file size limits (CLI `--max-size`, `0` = unlimited) | ✅ Done |

### Shipped in prior releases

CLI expansion and evaluator/tooling fixes (v0.6.x):

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| `csv` import, `comment`, `clear`, `fill`, `sort` commands | ✅ Done |
| Batch `put` smart mode, `--auto-fit` flag | ✅ Done |
| `rasterizers` command + multi-backend rasterization (`--rasterizer <name>`) | ✅ Done |
| Cross-sheet formula fix, eager-recalculation fix | ✅ Done |

### Planned / Future

Authoring and rendering features not yet shipped:

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| XLSM macro preservation policy + tests (macros never executed) | Planned |
| Data-validation / conditional-formatting **authoring** (currently preserved through edits, no write API) | Planned |
| Drawing Layer (Images, Shapes) | Planned |
| Chart Model | Planned |
| Two-phase streaming (SST + styles in row-stream write path) | Planned |
| Merged Cells in row-stream Write | Backlog |
| Query API | Backlog |
| Pivot Tables | Backlog |

## Completed Work

All completed phases are documented in git history. Key milestones:

- **P0-P8**: Foundation, OOXML, streaming, codecs, macros
- **WI-07/08/09**: Formula parser, evaluator (now **104 functions** after the 0.10.0 breadth pass)
- **TJC-1055** (closes GH-116): Text functions — TRIM, MID, FIND, SUBSTITUTE, VALUE, TEXT
- **WI-10**: Excel table support
- **WI-17**: SAX streaming write (36% faster than POI)
- **WI-19**: Row/column property serialization
- **0.10.0 "Trust & Author"**: named-range & hyperlink authoring, structural editing, theme resolution, function breadth (88 → 104), surgical-edit trust fixes C1–C5
