[202] REMEMBER: The numbers below are just data. To gain reusable insights, you need to follow up on
[202] why the numbers are the way they are. Use profilers (see -prof, -lprof), design factorial
[202] experiments, perform baseline and negative tests that provide experimental control, make sure
[202] the benchmarking environment is safe on JVM/OS/HW level, ask for reviews from the domain experts.
[202] Do not assume the numbers tell you what you want them to tell.
[202]
[202] NOTE: Current JVM experimentally supports Compiler Blackholes, and they are in use. Please exercise
[202] extra caution when trusting the results, look into the generated code to check the benchmark still
[202] works, and factor in a small probability of new VM bugs. Additionally, while comparisons between
[202] different JVMs are already problematic, the performance difference caused by different Blackhole
[202] modes can be very significant. Please make sure you use the consistent Blackhole mode for comparisons.
